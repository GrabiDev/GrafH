# GrafH
author: Matt Grabara
version: 1.0
year: 2009

This C++ header is the result of my attempts to prepare for the Olympiad in Informatics and self-study of Object-Oriented Programming, C++ and graph theory. This is my most successful and optimised version of a C++ header to handle graphs. It uses overloading setEdge function to allow for defining complex edges. Contains successful implementation of Dijkstra algorithm.

## Usage
Include `graf.h` header in your C++ source code.

## Demo
`grafDemo.cpp` contains source code of a simple demo showing how to define a graph and results of Dijkstra algorithm for the sample graph.
